# SV Tester Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains all resources necessary for the Stray Voltage Tester (SVT) project. It includes embedded software source codes, schematic diagrams, and Acceptance Test Procedures (ATP).

## Repository Structure

- **Code/** - Embedded source code and configuration files.
- **PDFs/**
  - **Schematics/** - Detailed circuit designs in PDF format.
  - **ATP/** - Acceptance Test Procedure documents.
- **README.md** - Information and guide on the repository contents.

## Detailed Contents

- **Schematics**
  - Contains PDFs of the electrical schematics exported from Altium Designer. Essential for hardware replication or modification.
- **ATP Documentation**
  - Provides a step-by-step guide on testing procedures to ensure project integrity and functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Radga9/SVT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to desired directories to view project files:
   ```bash
   cd SVT/PDFs/Schematics
   ```
3. Use appropriate software to open PDF documents (Adobe Reader) and source files (IDE or text editor).

## Prerequisites

- PDF reader for viewing the documentation.
- Embedded development environment like STM32CubeIDE for code modifications.

## Usage

- The source code can be edited and compiled for embedded systems development.
- Schematics are used for troubleshooting and understanding project hardware.
- ATP documents guide the testing and validation phase.

## Contributing

Contributions to the SVT project are welcome. Please ensure to update tests as appropriate and maintain the integrity of the schematics and ATP documentation.
